It is a mathematical structure where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.📝 OverviewPascal's Triangle is a classic problem used to demonstrate:Combinatorics: Each entry is a binomial coefficient, represented as $\binom{n}{k}$.Dynamic Programming: Using previous results to calculate current values.Recursion & Iteration: Comparing time and space complexity across different approaches.🔢 Mathematical LogicThe value at the $n^{th}$ row and $k^{th}$ column is calculated using the formula:$$C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$Alternatively, the iterative approach uses:The first and last element of every row is always 1.Any other element at row[i] and column[j] is:Triangle[i][j] = Triangle[i-1][j-1] + Triangle[i-1][j]📂 FeaturesCustomizable Rows: Generates the triangle up to $N$ rows.Optimized Space: Implementation reduces space complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ where applicable.Formatting: Clean, centered output for better visualization in the terminal.🚀 How to RunFor C ImplementationCompile the code:Bashgcc pascals_triangle.c -o pascals
